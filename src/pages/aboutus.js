            Protestant Christianity came to Chennai nearly three hundred years
            ago and spread to many parts of Tamil Nadu, it took a long time
            before the Good News was preached in the outskirts of the city such
            as Tambaram, Kanchipuram, Thiruvallur and Arakkonam. Two missionary
            bodies were responsible for the spread of Christianity in these
            regions: the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMM) and the
            Church of Scotland Mission (CSM). Rev. John Anderson of the CSM
            arrived in 1837 and founded schools and a native congregation in
            Chennai. The first Methodist missionary to India was James Lynch. He
            came to Chennai in 1817 and preached his first sermon on March 2,
            1817, in Georgetown (known then as Black Town).
